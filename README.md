# The Eternal Void
## A Java Text Adventure

------------------------------

This simulates my first Java Text adventure that demonstrates 
a fair usage of images to tell a story. Combat does need to be reworked,
though the game is fully functional. 

## Downloading and Playing

1. Clone the repo to your system. 
2. In an IDE run the program from Game.java

### The command line

## Future Plans

I plan to revisit this one day and fix the combat system. Adjusting some story
issues would be considered.
